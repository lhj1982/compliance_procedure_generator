|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Compute** | ECS Fargate | Cloud Run |
| **Database** | RDS PostgreSQL | Cloud SQL PostgreSQL |
| **Networking** | VPC | VPC |
| **Load Balancer** | Application Load Balancer | Cloud Load Balancer |

## Architecture Differences

### AWS Architecture
```
Internet → ALB → ECS Fargate (frontend) → ECS Fargate (backend) → RDS
                                                                      ↑
Bastion (EC2) ------------------------------------------------→-------┘
```

### GCP Architecture
```
Internet → Load Balancer → Cloud Run (frontend + nginx) → Cloud Run (backend) → Cloud SQL
                                                |                                   ↑
                                                +---(VPC Connector)------------------+
                                                                                     |
Bastion (Compute Engine) ---(Cloud SQL Proxy)--------------------------------→------┘
```

## Key Differences

### 1. Container Orchestration

**AWS (ECS Fargate):**
- Always-on containers (configurable task count)
- More granular control over container placement
- Requires task definitions and service configurations
- VPC integration built-in

**GCP (Cloud Run):**
- Serverless with scale-to-zero capability
- Automatic scaling based on requests
- Simpler configuration (just container image + env vars)
- Requires VPC Connector for private network access

**Winner for cost**: GCP (scale-to-zero in dev)
**Winner for control**: AWS (more configuration options)

### 2. Database Access

**AWS:**
- RDS in private subnet
- Direct VPC connectivity from ECS tasks
- Bastion uses standard PostgreSQL client

**GCP:**
- Cloud SQL with private IP (VPC peering)
- Cloud Run connects via VPC Connector
- Bastion uses Cloud SQL Proxy for secure connection

**Winner**: Tie (both secure and functional)

### 3. Reverse Proxy Setup

**AWS:**
- Can run separate containers for nginx and backend
- ALB can route directly to different services
- More flexibility in service architecture

**GCP:**
- Single container with nginx + backend (cost-optimized)
- Load balancer routes all traffic to frontend
- Frontend nginx proxies /api/* to backend service
- Simpler but less flexible

**Winner**: AWS (more flexible architecture)

### 4. Bastion Access

**AWS:**
- EC2 instance with SSH key authentication
- Security groups control access
- Can use Session Manager for keyless access

**GCP:**
- Compute Engine with IAP (Identity-Aware Proxy)
- No SSH keys needed (uses Google identity)
- No external IP required
- Free secure tunneling

**Winner**: GCP (IAP is more secure and convenient)

### 5. Load Balancing

**AWS:**
- Application Load Balancer
- Path-based routing built-in
- SSL/TLS termination easy to configure

**GCP:**
- Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer
- URL map for routing
- Integrated with Cloud Armor for DDoS protection
- Can leverage Cloud CDN easily

**Winner**: Tie (both are excellent)

## Cost Comparison (Monthly Estimates)

### Development Environment (Low Traffic)

| Service | AWS | GCP |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Compute** | ECS Fargate: ~$15-30 | Cloud Run: ~$0-10 (scale-to-zero) |
| **Database** | RDS db.t3.micro: ~$15 | Cloud SQL db-f1-micro: ~$7 |
| **Load Balancer** | ALB: ~$23 | Load Balancer: ~$18 |
| **NAT** | NAT Gateway: ~$32 | Cloud NAT: ~$3 |
| **Bastion** | t3.micro: ~$7 | e2-micro (preemptible): ~$3.50 |
| **VPC/Networking** | ~$5 | VPC Connector: ~$7 |
| **Total** | **~$97-112/month** | **~$38-48/month** |

**Winner**: GCP is ~60% cheaper for dev

### Production Environment (Medium Traffic)

| Service | AWS | GCP |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Compute** | ECS Fargate: ~$70-120 | Cloud Run: ~$50-100 |
| **Database** | RDS db.t3.small: ~$30 | Cloud SQL db-g1-small: ~$25 |
| **Load Balancer** | ALB: ~$23 | Load Balancer: ~$18 |
| **NAT** | NAT Gateway: ~$45 | Cloud NAT: ~$10 |
| **Bastion** | t3.micro: ~$7 | e2-micro: ~$7 |
| **VPC/Networking** | ~$10 | VPC Connector: ~$14 |
| **Total** | **~$185-235/month** | **~$124-174/month** |

**Winner**: GCP is ~30-35% cheaper for production

## Deployment Complexity

### AWS
- More verbose Terraform (task definitions, services, target groups)
- Requires ECS cluster setup
- More moving parts to configure
- Better for teams familiar with AWS

### GCP
- Simpler Terraform (Cloud Run is more declarative)
- Less infrastructure to manage
- Serverless nature reduces operational overhead
- Better for teams wanting simplicity

**Winner**: GCP (simpler deployment)

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring & Logging

**AWS:**
- CloudWatch Logs (included)
- CloudWatch Metrics
- X-Ray for tracing
- More mature ecosystem

**GCP:**
- Cloud Logging (included)
- Cloud Monitoring
- Cloud Trace
- Simpler integration

**Winner**: AWS (more mature tooling)

### Scaling

**AWS:**
- ECS Auto Scaling with target tracking
- Predictable scaling behavior
- Can maintain minimum task count

**GCP:**
- Cloud Run automatic scaling
- Scale to zero in dev
- Faster cold starts
- Less control over scaling

**Winner**: Depends on use case
- Dev: GCP (scale-to-zero)
- Prod: AWS (more control)

### Security

**AWS:**
- IAM roles for tasks
- Security groups
- AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store
- VPC security groups

**GCP:**
- Service accounts
- Firewall rules
- Secret Manager
- IAP for bastion (superior)

**Winner**: Tie (both excellent)

## When to Choose AWS

1. Your team is already familiar with AWS
2. You need more control over container orchestration
3. You want always-on containers with predictable costs
4. You're building a complex microservices architecture
5. You need extensive AWS service integrations

## When to Choose GCP

1. You want serverless with scale-to-zero
2. Cost optimization is critical (especially dev environments)
3. You prefer simpler infrastructure
4. You want IAP for secure bastion access
5. You're starting fresh and want modern tooling

## Migration Considerations

### AWS → GCP
- Container images are compatible (just push to GCR)
- Need to adapt networking (VPC Connector vs direct VPC)
- Database migration: Use pg_dump/pg_restore
- Update DNS to new load balancer IP

### GCP → AWS
- Container images compatible (just push to ECR)
- Need ECS task definitions
- Adapt from Cloud Run to Fargate services
- Update DNS to new ALB DNS

## Recommendation

**For this specific application:**

- **Development**: **GCP** (60% cost savings, scale-to-zero)
- **Production**: **GCP** (30% cost savings, simpler ops)
- **Enterprise**: **AWS** (if already using AWS ecosystem)

## Hybrid Approach

You could also run:
- Dev environments on GCP (cheaper)
- Production on AWS (if required by organization)
- Use same Docker images for both
- Different Terraform modules for each cloud

## Bottom Line

Both architectures are production-ready and secure. The choice depends on:

1. **Cost sensitivity**: Choose GCP
2. **Existing infrastructure**: Stay with what you have
3. **Team expertise**: Use what your team knows
4. **Operational preferences**: AWS for control, GCP for simplicity

The provided Terraform makes it easy to deploy to either cloud!
